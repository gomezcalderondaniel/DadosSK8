# 🎲 SK8 DADOS

**SK8 DICE** is a minimalist, mobile-first skateboarding trick generator inspired by physical dice.  
Roll the dice, get a stance + trick combination, and skate.

The project blends **skate culture**, **tactile UI design**, and **simple web technology** to create a playful training tool for skaters of all levels.

## 🛹 What Is It?

SK8 DICE simulates two wooden dice:

- **Left Dice** → Stance / approach  
  (Natural, Switch, Fakie, Nollie, etc.)
- **Right Dice** → Trick  
  (Kickflip, Heelflip, Shove-it, etc.)

A difficulty selector allows users to change the **trick set** dynamically while keeping the stance dice consistent.
